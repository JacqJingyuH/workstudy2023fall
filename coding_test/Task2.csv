"The way I differentiate the two is that news provide information on a current event, while opinions try to convince readers to adopt a particular position on that event",,,,,,,
"News should be neutral; it should not be conveying author's view on the matter, nor to include words that try to lead readers to certain stance on that matter. ",,,,,,,
